@linedevice_talk_welcome_message Welcome to Delta Chat! ‚Äì Delta Chat looks and feels like other popular messenger apps, but does not involve centralized control, tracking or selling you, friends, colleagues or family out to large organizations.

Technically, Delta Chat is an e-mail application with a modern chat interface. E-mail in a new dress if you will üëª

Use Delta Chat with anyone out of billions of people: just use their e-mail address. Recipients don\'t need to install Delta Chat, visit websites or sign up anywhere - however, of course, if they like, you may point them to üëâ https://get.delta.chat
