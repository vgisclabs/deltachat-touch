# Core translation files

The translation files in assets/coreTranslations are an extract of the translations made by the DeltaChat Community on Transifex, see [https://app.transifex.com/delta-chat/public/](https://app.transifex.com/delta-chat/public/).

The extracts are used for setting the core translations via `dc_set_stock_translation()` in plugins/DeltaHandler/ifElseSetCoreTranslation.cpp.
